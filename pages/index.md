# NAACP - National Association for the Advancement of Colored People

The NAACP, the most widely acknowledged civil rights organization, made headway during the twentieth century in fighting to secure rights for African Americans. They rallied behind several major events, supported legal actions, and even made life a little better. The formation of the NAACP in the early twentieth century proved to be an important educator and supporter in African American civil rights.
