## Introduction

## NAACP Creation

Springfield, Illinois August 14, 1908, two African American men, accused of assaulting two Euro-American women, found themselves incarcerated on these allegations. An unsatisfied mob wanted the charged men lynched. They approached the jail expecting the prisoners released so they could enact their own justice. The jail-keeper, however, refused them access. Enraged, the mob targeted two other African American men who had not committed any crimes and lynched them instead. Three days the mob ran amuck, mostly Euro-Americans, destroying African American owned businesses and homes. Almost two thousand African Americans vacated the town while the Springfield Race Riot occurred and never returned.[^1]

When looking back, early twentieth century lynching seems unorthodox. Oftentimes, we do not correlate lynching as a pre-1950s or 60s phenomenon because those riots impacted our understandings as media outlets made racial issues more widespread causing resonating images. Many times, people do not realize the 1960s Civil Rights campaign culminated because one hundred years later African Americans still encountered slave-like misery. However, lynching became a tolerated practice when slavery ended and continued throughout the early twentieth century.
