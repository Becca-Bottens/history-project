## Introduction

## NAACP Creation

Springfield, Illinois August 14, 1908, two African American men, accused of assaulting two Caucasian women, found themselves incarcerated on these allegations. An unsatisfied mob wanted the charged men lynched. They approached the jail expecting the prisoners released so they could enact their own justice. The jail-keeper, however, refused them access. Enraged, the mob targeted two other African American men who had not committed any crimes and lynched them instead. Three days the mob ran amuck, mostly Caucasians, destroying African American owned businesses and homes. Almost two thousand African Americans vacated the town while the Springfield Race Riot occurred and never returned.[^1]

When looking back, early twentieth century lynching seems unexpected. Oftentimes, we do not correlate lynching as a pre-1950s or 60s phenomenon because those riots impacted our understandings as media outlets made racial issues more widespread causing resonating images. Many times, people do not realize the 1960s Civil Rights campaign culminated because one hundred years later African Americans still encountered slave-like misery. However, at the closing of slavery, lynching continued as a tolerated practice into the early twentieth century.  

So, our 1908 lynching mob, denied accessing the prisoners who, so the story goes, committed a crime involving two women, chose two other African American men who committed no crimes and lynched them. Inhumane acts such as these prompted the organization of the NAACP.

Late 1908 brought together sixty members fighting unbridled violent acts such as the August 14 scenario. Seven African Americans, including such names as W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, and Mary Church Terrell, comprised those sixty members. The meeting issued a call discussing race-related justice. Their undertakings created the *National Association for the Advancement of Colored People* (NAACP). This organization set out to fight for and secure the rights given and guaranteed by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments contained in the United States Constitution.[^2]

•	**Thirteenth Amendment:** Section1:
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.[^3]

•	**Fourteenth Amendment:** Section 1:
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.[^4]

•	**Fifteenth Amendment:** Section 1: 
The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.[^5]

The NAACP believed in the rights embraced in the United States Constitution. They understood these rights meant for ALL citizens of the United States. Injustice throughout the country towards African Americans forced the NAACP to move forward by forming a collective to combat *justice for all*. The vision of the NAACP is to establish a society containing equal rights for all persons without racial hatred or discrimination. They work throughout the country certifying political, educational, social, and economic equality of all.[^6] The NAACP embarked on a mission against societal norms to educate citizens of their prejudices, injustices, and barriers created to keep the African Americans from progressing in the way the United States Constitution has afforded for them. Now, if we may, examine some examples, reasons, and ways the NAACP has grappled with these issues.

## Anti-Lynching and the NAACP

Now, we have all heard the stories of lynching and seen the pictures. But how often do we read the full story? When we think of lynching maybe we think of an African American man standing on the ground with rope around his neck, looking guilty, about to be hoisted. Maybe we just see the ending picture of a man hanging. What happened during the terrifying moments before that? Did they just walk willingly? Were those being lynched always guilty? Was it only men as pictures show?

(A word of caution for the next paragraph, you are about to read a nauseating situation.)

May 19, 1918, in Brooks County, Georgia, Mary Turner, an eight months pregnant African American woman, was strung up by her feet from a tree, set on fire, and while still alive had her baby cut out of her and stomped on in front of her eyes. After this her lynchers riddled her with bullets.[^7] Mary committed no crime except speaking her mind. How and why did this happen to her? 

A farmer named Hampton Smith would bail African Americans out of jail and make them work their time on his farm. He was known for mistreating these hires. Basically, a newfound modern-day slavery. One of the men bailed out of jail, Sidney Johnson, accused Mr. Smith of overworking him and ended up killing the farmer. Five other African American men were targeted with an accusation of conspiracy against Mr. Smith. One of these five men was a Mr. Hayes Turner. On May 18th the lynching mob, not local judicial systems who are the ones that should dole out punishment after a conviction of guilty, lynched this man because he worked with Mr. Johnson. Mrs. Turner, the next day, spoke her mind against the death of her husband. Because of this, she was taken right away to her horrifying fate.[^8] In one newspaper her hanging was justified because there was a gold watch “found” in her possession that was said to have belonged to the farmer, Mr. Smith, which then they said this indicated that the plot for killing Mr. Smith originated in her house.[^9]

How did the NAACP involve itself in the anti-lynching movement? As the new century dawned, lynching showed no signs of slowing. The years 1901 to 1929 saw more than 1,200 African Americans lynched in the South. The two most violent states were Georgia and Mississippi carrying forty percent of that number.[^10] In 1916 the NAACP joined forces with the Anti-Lynching Crusaders. In 1922 they rallied behind the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill which was meant to protect persons from mob assemblage and make lynching a punishable crime.[^11] While this bill was passed by the House of Representatives, it never made it out of the Senate. But this did not stop the NAACP from wanting justice. 

In 1935 a new wave of anti-lynching legislature arose. Two Senators, Robert F. Wagner from New York, and Edward Costigan from Colorado introduced a new bill, the Costigan-Wagner bill, to legalize prosecution of mob members and any public officials not protecting the victims. While this bill also did not become law, lynching received greater national attention thanks to these efforts.[^12] One interesting fact is that lynching was never deemed illegal the entirety of the twentieth century. While it was said to have been eliminated with the Civil Rights movement, there are some speculations that “accidental” deaths may have been an outcome of lynchers.

## NAACP and Brown v. Board of Education

Now, if we may, transition away from the lynching subject to another area where the NAACP placed their influence behind. Imagine with me, if you will, being an adolescent already struggling inside your own body with the changes that naturally occur and wondering why nature hates you. Now, imagine being a 1950s African American adolescent dealing with these changes on top of poverty, segregation, racial hatred, and wondering whether or not your school will have the proper supplies for you to get a good education. 

In post-World War II America, a high school diploma became essential for many jobs. However, educational opportunities were uneven between African Americans and Caucasians. In the southern states, African American and even Hispanic children were mostly underfunded and segregated. Their schools were usually run down, overcrowded, and lacked libraries, gyms, and even indoor plumbing. Often times the majority of these children attended schools in rural areas where their parents worked the fields. These rural areas usually did not have high schools for them to even attempt to attain a diploma. This would then hinder them from getting better jobs and of course a college education.[^13]

In 1896, the Plessy v. Ferguson case was approved in the Supreme Court which allowed segregation in schools so long as the educational opportunities were “approximately” the same. But, of course, most schools would find loopholes around this. On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in schools violated the fourteenth amendment. There was a grouping of five different cases for the same thing under the name the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. The positive outcome of the Brown v. Board of Education case was the turning point in African American civil rights acknowledgements. This was the first major step in a different direction than previously accepted and sometimes is thought to be the beginning of the Civil Rights movement as well as the pivotal moment of destroying Jim Crow laws.[^14]

So, how did the NAACP involve itself in the Brown v. Board of Education ruling? Since the 1930s, the NAACP had been working hard to end segregation. In 1933, an attorney, Nathan Margold, of the NAACP staff drafted a strategy to challenge segregation in education facilities. But at the time he knew this would not bode well with the public and the economic depression occurring at the same time put a damper on things as well. Highs and lows persisted in court cases through the 1930s and 40s until culminating into the Brown v. Board of Education cases. All cases used the segregation strategy with intentions of eliminating the “separate but equal” doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson.[^15]
