## Introduction

## NAACP Creation

	Springfield, Illinois August 14, 1908, two African American men were accused of assaulting two Euro-American women. These two men were subsequently jailed, and a mob came looking for the charged men. The jail-keeper did not allow this mob access to the accused. Unsatisfied with not gaining access, the mob targeted two other African American men that had not committed any crimes and lynched them in place of the two that were jailed. Over the course of three days the mob, mostly Euro-Americans, destroyed African American owned businesses and homes. The Springfield Race Riot ran almost two thousand African American residents out of town to never return.
