## Introduction

The late nineteenth century was a period of changes on a global scale which influenced political structures of the arriving twentieth century. Darwinism, Marxism, and the Industrial Revolution were newly emerging ideas and ways of life which influenced the people of the United States. With these new inventions and ways of thinking, the founding designs of our country started to blur into past and future notions. “Individual,” “collective,” and “for the greater good,” started mixing and intertwining in ways that our founding fathers never intended. 
  
### -Individualism

### -Liberalism

### -Objectivism

### -Exceptionalism
  
These are all views contained within the founding documents. The Declaration of Independence tells us of our unalienable rights, those that cannot be taken or given away. This is to say that we have rights to be independent and pursue our own achievements. Individualism and liberalism are more focused in the first half of the twentieth century while objectivism and exceptionalism were popping up around the 1960s. In essence, though, they contain the same aims of individual freedom just in a different uniform and under a new shell. These concepts, after the emergence of the above mentioned nineteenth century philosophical theories – Marxism and Darwinism, have been under attack since the beginning of the twentieth century forcing the United States citizens to question their own interpretations of freedom. Are we being selfish by continuing to hold fast to the original concepts centering the whole reason for the Revolutionary War? Or are we struggling as a country because these practices are of old and need to be eradicated? 

## Why the big words?

Individualism, liberalism, objectivism, and exceptionalism, big fancy tung tangling words, represent an independence, a freedom to choose, to reason with oneself, to be oneself without a governing body or higher authority stepping in to tell you what to do, how to do it, or when to do it. These concepts have received abounding backlash for over a century now. Arguments against these concepts have arisen in the wake of misunderstanding and taking out of context the core principles that construct these ideas. 

With respect, I would like to take a minute here and explain that Americans are by no means perfect. We have now spent a few hundred years working on and building a free world. We are human beings and we have made mistakes, some atrociously so. What I am not trying to say here is that these ideas explain or justify slavery or other oppressions as a matter of building America. No, just as we still have today, past patrons of this country have misused these ideas to make personal gains at the expense of others. This, however, is not the core principle that makes up these concepts that are meant to build the nation. Let us dive into these ideologies that make up this list of tung tangling words.

## What is Happiness?

The Declaration of Independence, as everyone should know, states *that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness*.[^1]

Now, the pursuit of happiness, tends to be the most misconstrued and this is the center phrase for the above words. During an interview in 1961, Ayn Rand tells that the pursuit of happiness spoken of in the Declaration of Independence is not the same as what is thought of today. She says that pursuit is not an act of chasing, but rather an act of achieving and happiness is not an act of momentary pleasures or mindless self-indulgences, contrarily it is guiltless pride in what you have achieved.[^2]  How has this phrase been misconstrued? Pursuit of happiness does not mean borrowing your neighbor’s car for a joy ride and returning it with an empty tank of gas. The right to pursue happiness *cannot negatively impact the rights of others*.[^3] Yes, this phrase has been interpreted in favor of desires ever since the document was signed and throughout all of history, again we are human, imperfect. However, pursuit of happiness is being an individual, forging progress, and achieving a better life without hindering the next person’s own pursuit.

## Individualism Looks Like…

In 1922, Herbert Hoover penned down his ideas of American Individualism. Individualism is the freedom to reason and act on one’s own accord to achieve one’s own goals.[^4] Now, along with this definition, we must also remember the meaning behind pursuit of happiness and not forget that we want to achieve something good without interfering with other’s rights. In his book, Hoover states that *individualism has been the primary force of American civilization*.[^5] He further said, *there will always be a frontier to conquer or to hold as long as men think, plan, and dare*.[^6] Often, when we hear the word frontier, we think of open prairie plains and expanding the west, but that is not the only frontier out there. The American Pioneer makes waves in all sorts of divisions in life. 

In 1902 a woman named Mary Anderson was riding in a car in New York City while it was snowing and the driver had to periodically stop the car to clear the windshield.[^7] Upon arriving back home in Alabama, she put together a plan for a “window cleaning device” that looked much like what we use today and was powered from the inside of the car. The only difference was a manual hand crank.[^8] 



Mary used her individual skills to formulate a new product that would allow us to one day drive eighty miles an hour down a road in a torrential downpour and still be able to see where we are going, even if it is just barely. She had to think for herself, she had to work for herself. Probably the only time the invention of the windshield wiper invaded someone else would be when it flies off your windshield driving eighty miles an hour down the road in a torrential downpour. (Inoperable wipers do not count in this argument, that is another argument.) Individualism does not mean that we selfishly covet our own ideas not allowing others to benefit from them as well. This also does not include the idea of inventing a torture machine to use on society. It is being a new person, seeing where things can change, and making it happen to look back on it and say, “Yeah, I did that!” To be able to do this without monarchs or churches stepping in to stop you because you are making them look bad because they did not think of it first.

## Which Liberalism?

Liberalism has become a liberal term. Classical liberalism is the term now used for the original ideas from the founding fathers. Liberal freedoms were freedom of expression, to reason, to better yourself, and create your own life.[^9] Again, pursuit of happiness, but not interfering with other’s pursuit of their own happiness. So, what happened? Well, someone came along and shook things up. Now do not get me wrong, Franklin Roosevelt was an exceptional leader and accomplished many great things in his presidency and yes, I like the guy. But, he needed to figure out how to save a drowning country. Not such a big deal, right? From the beginning of his presidency, he introduced new liberal freedoms and meanings. He turned the tables of government interaction. During a campaign speech in 1932, he stated that a new government was required. A government that owed an avenue to provide sufficient needs to the people.[^10]



Quoted in a article was an article published on June 4, 1955 in *The New Republic* penned by Reinhold Niebuhr who said that liberalism was now the commitment of the government *to free the individual from the traditional restraints of a society, to endow the ‘governed’ with the power of the franchise, to establish the principle of the ‘consent of the governed’ as the basis of political society; to challenge all hereditary privileges and traditional restraints upon human initiatives*.[^11] Are you catching the words used here? To Free, Endow, Establish, Challenge; this is saying that now it is up to the government to decide if our thoughts are correct or our inventions are useful. Now to look at this under the black light, going back to Miss Mary Anderson, her windshield wiper invention was rejected by a manufacturing firm with them telling her, *we do not consider it to be of such commercial value*.[^12]  What happens when the government is the one telling you your thoughts and ideas have no value to the country? Have I flown off my rocker, or did you just there? 

## Concluding Thoughts

Ok so, pursuit of happiness. Is being an American, pursuing our own happiness in the sense of the founding fathers, selfish? My answer is a hard no. Again, please do not forget that we are all humans. We will make mistakes and yes sometimes do things for our own good. But the reality is that the leaders of this country are and have all been human as well. They have and continue to make mistakes. That is part of life, part of learning, and part of understanding our own reasons. Individualism is not an act of selfishness. Ultimately, it is an act of building a better future with pride. Liberalism, in the classical (founding fathers) sense, was an idea to better yourself and improve life. Wordings of the past have been misconstrued and misunderstood from their original meanings. If we leave our happiness in the hands of the government, then some voices will be drowned out even if their ideas will solve huge problems.
