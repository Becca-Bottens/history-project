## Introduction

1. Price V. Fishback

In the article *Did New Deal Grant Programs Stimulate Local Economies? A Study of Federal Grants and Retail Sales During the Great Depression,* explains that centerpieces of the **New Deal** consisted of contrasting impacts of effectiveness in relief and recovery efforts. They support these explanations by demonstrating how the New Deal offers a unique opportunity to learn how federal expenditures can influence local economies. With this their purpose is to examine how the programs influenced retail sales as a general measure of economic activity in order to understand the individual impacts of the New Deal during the Great Depression. The authors write in a formal tone for academics.

Title sections of your essay with headings, by adding a pound sign (`#`) in front of the title:
